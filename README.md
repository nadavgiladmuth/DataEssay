The chart below displays the top ten most frequently observed butterfly species in Delaware County from March 2020 to March 2025. The data is sourced from the citizen science platform iNaturalist.

According to the chart, the most common butterfly species in Delaware County in the past five years has been the Huron Sachem (Atalopedes huron). Although not apparent from it's name, the Huron Sachem is a species of Skipper Butterfly, a subspecies that has made numerious entries in the top ten list. The Huron Sachem is joined by the Zabulon Skipper, Peck's Skipper, and Silver-spotted Skipper as the most common Skipper species in Delaware County. From this data, we can understand that Delaware County provides suitable habitat for Skipper species that typically reside in grass praries or alongside coastal marshes. Another takeaway can be observed from the high count of Monarch butterflies observed in the past five years. Monarch butterflies only lay their eggs on the Milkweed plant, meaning that a high count of Monarch butterflies observed in Delaware County also suggests that this county provides suitable conditions for the Milkweed plant to thrive here.
